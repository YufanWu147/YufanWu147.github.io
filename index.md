I am a first-year Ph.D. student at MD Anderson UT Health Houston Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences. Currently I am doing rotation at Dr. Wenyi Wang's laboratory at MD Anderson.

Prior to my Ph.D. study, I was an Associate Computational Biologist at Dr. Vijay Kuchroo's laboratory at Brigham and Women's Hospital. I received my M.S. in Health Data Science at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and B.S. in Applied Statistics at Central University of Finance and Economics in Beijing.

My research focus on using bulk and single-cell sequencing data to understand the biology behind human diseases.

Outside of research, I enjoy theatre and performing arts, reading, and hiking.
